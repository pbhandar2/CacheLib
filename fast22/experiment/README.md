# Installation 

Clone the block stressor repo 

git clone https://github.com/pbhandar2/CacheLib.git

Clone the data repo 

git clone https://github.com/pbhandar2/MTCacheData.git

mount the backing storage device and create a large file
mount the NVM device and create a large file

### Example large file creation of size 500GB 
dd if=/dev/urandom of=${BACKING_DIR}/disk.file bs=1M count=500000 oflag=direct 

go to Cachelib/fast22/experiments/

edit mt_config_template.json and st_config_template.json 
- diskFilePath: path to a large file in the mount used as a backing store 
- nvmCachePaths: path to a large file in the NVM mount 
- traceList: path to the block trace 

now you can run the basic experiment using the scirpt, run_basic_experiment.sh
